# metagenomeIntegrated
metagenomeIntegrated

An integrated pipeline for the prediction of the bacterial genomes and analysis and visualization of the pangenomes from ROARY, PIRATE, PEPPAN, PANROO. This allows you to run the three accurate pangenome predictions from ROARY, PEPPAN, PIRATE, PANROO and then gives the pangenomes. It also gives a comparative assessment of the pangenomes
that is conserved across all through a venn visualization. There are several versions and is in beta testing and the complete package will be updated with the final release as metagenomeIntegrated_release.R

However, you are free to try it and report the bugs and i would be more than happy to acknowledge you in the git contributions.
